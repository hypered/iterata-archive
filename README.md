# Lex Iterata - Archive test

[Lex Iterata](https://refli.be/fr/lex) is a project to collect and transform
the content of the Belgian Official Journal web site. It presents that content
in an enhanced format for human comprehension, while also providing structured
data tailored for machine consumption.

This Git repository is an experiment to generate one Markdown file (similar to
what is done in [iterata-md](https://github.com/hypered/iterata-md)) for one
example legislative text, and doing it again for all its archived versions.

Each version of one text is recorded in a separate commit. This lets us have a
better idea of what Git can offer, including existing the GitHub interface to
explore the different versions.
